**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

Create a program that reads all the attendees in a file and then outputs the seats.

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First we read the readme file, then we talked about the high level steps we wanted to refactor into functions. Then we did the algorithm, and completed and tested the code.

**What were the Key concepts explored?**

Loops, File input and output, storing data, pair programming

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

Yes.

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. There is error checking in place so that the user must enter a file name that exists.

**What challenges did you encounter?**

The only big challenge I had was an issue with the spacing when printing the names.

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**

1. Think before Programming: We read the read me file, discussed high-level steps, and completed our algorithm before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: Our code follows our algorithm
3. Improve through practice: We improved our pair programming / coding skills by completing this lab.

**Did you overcome them, and how?**

Yes. I changed the way I had the print statements and found there was an unnecessary space in one of them 

**Any key takeaways?**

By planning our functions in a very intentional way, we saved a lot of time in the actual programming part. 

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

Yes. I feel much more confident about working with files.

**What was it like working with your partner?**
It was good. He is very easy to bounce ideas off of and is good to work with.
